# Matplotlib Exercises

### This is a repo that I created for saving my answers to Matplotlib exercises that I found on Internet

### To run it:
``` python -m venv venv ```

``` source venv/bin/activate ```  - on Linux

or ``` venv\bin\Activate.ps1 ``` - on Windows

And, inside the venv: ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
